# alt:V C++ Example Resource

## How To Use

To build the project just run `build.bat`.
The built DLL will be in the `dist` directory.
You need the [C++ module](https://github.com/LeonMrBonnie/altv-cpp-module) to run the resource.

## Why is this so shit

Because I suck at C++, but not even God can stop me from creating this abomination.
